## KeyNotes

### Making things open - Hadley Beeman (U.K. Government | W3C)

Openness is good for Government on many levels ” open data, open standards, open source, open markets. Where we set the way we work in Government, its important to let industry determine the technical standards we work with.

### How Facebook open sources at scale - James Pearce (Facebook)

Ship a lot, or ship fast? These goals may seem to be at odds, but it's actually possible to have large, diverse portfolios of open source projects and maintain a fast-moving, iterative approach. In this talk, Facebook's open source lead James Pearce will discuss how Facebook is able to ship open source products twice a week and maintain quality, size, and speed.

### They're here. Now what? - Allison Randal (Hewlett-Packard and Open Source Initiative)

The early days of the open source movement were all about creating an approachable on-ramp to software freedom. We focused strongly on practical benefits of free software and refined the message, hoping to help the professional software sector better understand. We succeeded but success in our first goal doesn't mean we're done, it means we're due to clearly define the next phase of open source.

### On change-making at the largest public interest startup - Mikey Dickerson (Federal Government | United States Digital Services Team)

The Federal Governments approach to technology is outdated and maddening. But this dysfunction didnt come out of thin air”its rooted in deep, structural realities. Less than a year old, the U.S. Digital Service is hacking bureaucracy and improving services millions rely on every day. Mikey will talk about how that work is going and how the group is spurring change in the open.

### Hacking Conway's Law - Raffi Krikorian (Uber Advanced Technologies Center)

Re-architecting a system is wrought with problems. However, what we can sometimes forget is the most important aspect of any project: the team! Your team, who miraculously survives these projects, has to continue to change with your business and your technology! But, don't fret, we can architect our way towards this way of thinking!

> Conor – conway's law states that our system architecture will tend to match our departmental structure. suggests refactoring your teams like you refactor your code.

### From analog to digital and back - George Dyson (Independent)

Nature uses digital coding for replication, storage, and error correction, but relies on analog coding for control. Technology will follow. We are starting to treat streams of bits the way vacuum tubes treat streams of electrons, implementing analog processing upon a digital substrate, the same way digital processing was implemented using analog components, the first time around.

> Conor – a brief travel on the origins and players in modern computing and how we're starting to turn back to analog non-deterministic systems like deep learning to solve the truly hard problems

### Microservices. Microservices everywhere! - JÃ©rÃ´me Petazzoni (Docker Inc.)

Thanks to Docker and containers, microservices architectures are no longer reserved to large organizations like Netflix or Amazon. Let's review the benefits of those architectures, for Devs and Ops, in projects big and small, and how to realize them with the open source container technology available today.

> Conor –The presentation is less theoritical and has a nice live demo showing how to build and link multiple docker containers with Docker Compose . Also looks at dynamic scaling with Docker swarm [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) [swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/)  [Slides] (http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/129/Microservices_%20Microservices%20everywhere_%20Presentation.pdf)

### Space, time, and state - Amy Palamountain (GitHub)

Reactive programming is the trendy new way to build desktop and mobile apps. Reacting to user input over time can prove to be difficult, because of the enormous amount of state we need to keep track of. In this talk we will discover how to improve our reactive applications by removing the need for state entirely. This allows us to clearly reason about, and react to, user input over time.

> Conor – Reactive design - modeling states with immutables (C# examples ). Has a bunch of useful resources at end of presentation.

### Java-based microservices, containers, Kubernetes - how to - Ray Tsang (Google)

Join this session to learn how to create a Java-based microservice using Spring Boot, containerize it using Maven plugins, and subsequently deploy a fleet of microservices and dependent components such as Redis using Kubernetes. Toward the end of the session, let's take a look at how we can apply the same patterns to other runtimes, such as Vert.x and Grails.

> Conor – Recommended -slightly different from spencer gib's demo of spring-netflix-oss microservices , focuses more on the orchestration and management of those services using kubernetes which has a cool graphical ui showing the service dependencies and redundancies

### Reactive front end - Martin Gontovnikas (Auth0)

There's been a lot of talk about reactive programming lately, but nobody really knows exactly what it is. I'll first talk a little bit about what reactive programming is, and then we'll dive into practical examples on how to use it with any front-end technology and particularly with AngularJS. We'll see how beautiful and clean our code can be when we use reactive code in the front end.

> Conor – This is aimed a narrow audience i.e those who need to process high volums of streamed data within the browser. the lecture describes how to use RxJs and the Observable pattern to efficient process that data in the browser. Java already handles this correcly using the .stream() and .map() interfaces . For slides and code see website [oscon-reactive-frontend](https://auth0.com/events/oscon-reactive-frontend)

### Test-driven repair - Christopher Neugebauer (@chrisjrn)

Test-driven development's great, but what happens when you find yourself working on code where automated testing took a back seat to being shipped? This talk looks at techniques for automated testing of late-stage or even production code, and how to use this to fix bugs in your code. Testing late in life isn't a lost cause any more!

> Conor – disappointing , mostly common-sense obvious info. Nothing new

### Choose boring technology - Dan McKinley (Stripe)

How do you choose the technology to run your business? You should use the best tools for the job, of course. But the precise definitions of the words "best" and "job" are tricky. This talk gives these terms shape, and introduces a framework for thinking about new technology rigorously, holistically, and systematically.

> Conor – A celebration and justification of taking the well traveled path.

### Migrating PHP runtimes to HHVM: Taking the plunge - Joe Marrama (Box)

Changing the engine that runs a large PHP application is fraught with hidden dangers but comes with large rewards. In this talk, I'll detail the process Box went through to safely make the transition to running our production site on top of HHVM.

> Conor - Box describes how they use the HHVM to speed up PHP. hhvm developed by facebook will first interpret the php and the compile to assembly after multiple runthroughs . it's basically the Java JVM for PHP. but one that requires "warming up" and still can have garbage collection issues . some of the techniques they use for deployment are appropriate for any major new deployment.

### Programming single-page applications - Brian Capouch (Saint Josephs College), Nathan Samano (Saint Joseph's College (Indiana)), and Craig Austgen (Saint Joseph's College)

Single-page web applications offer users a rich, responsive experience, utilizing the browser as an application platform. We provide a framework-agnostic introduction to programming single-page applications, considered generically. Server- and client-side routing, module API surfacing, bookmarking, and SEO strategies must be carefully managed in an SPA environment.

> Conor - not a particularly compelling presentation of why to use single page apps. This does talk about some of the issues e.g security, routing etc

### InnerSource as the anti-silo: How open source style has broken silos while strengthening systems at PayPal - Cedric Williams (PayPal)

Maturing engineering organizations tend to coalesce into silos around products, technologies, and business units. InnerSource uses proven open source approaches for development inside the firewall, bypassing the constraints of silo architecture while increasing velocity and quality. This session will examine how InnerSource is growing at PayPal and what has been learned so far.

> Conor – paypal has a core/foundation group that acts as a gatekeeper. This descibes how whe they moved to a mentor based approach they were able to reduce re-writes and increase tecnical knowledge across the company. They used the same pull request review process common on OS projects

### Build a community of practice, one PR at a time: Using GitHub to teach the values of open source - Peter Bell (Ronin Labs)

The pull request is both a feature and a philosophy--it takes a stand on openness, collaboration and culture. While most PR use cases are straightforward, other novel uses offer deeper learning opportunities. Well walk through different ways to deploy pull requests to model the values of open source, share understanding, learn from mistakes, and build a community of practice.

> Conor – how to use github as an education tool. This has some very interesting ideas which I might be able to apply to the Java-Data-Tier course I teach at UW.

### It's metaphors all the way down - Brian Proffitt (Red Hat)

Everything we do in technology - operating systems, applications, systems administration - is based on nothing solid and real, but rather conceptualizations and ideas that we make accessible through metaphors. In fact, far from being "non-creative," nerd-types may be among the most creative storytellers in history.

### Say No like a boss! - Deb Nicholson (Open Invention Network)

There's always plenty to do in the world of free and open source software, but saying yes to it all eventually leads to burnout. Not every job, module or meeting is going to lead to more of the kinds of opportunities you want. When should you reinvent the wheel and when should you settle for something that's good enough?

> Conor – Recommended . AKA how to say "No...But" to your boss. This explains how to avoid thrashing and randomization with some verbal approaches that don't make you the bad guy . I found myself coming back to this presentation after watching it once already

### Fear of failing fast: How to avoid sabotaging your success - Leslie Hawthorn (Elastic) and Amye Scavarda (Amye.org)

While its easy to pay lip service to the idea of innovating by failing fast, humans are both neurally geared and financially incentivized to avoid failure. How can we create an environment that makes failing fast safe for the participants and their organizations?

> Conor – avoid - this talks about how why we really don't like failure, but This doesn't really have much in the way of concrete recommendations to encourage risk taking beyond using strecthh goals.

### Building your open resume - Mark Ferree (Chapter Three)

It is not in your best interest to leave most of your work hidden away at your employer. GitHub has created a showcase for your work, and hiring managers will spend time looking through your work before you are invited to come in for an interview. I will cover strategies for increasing both the quality and quantity of your open source contributions to improve your open resume.

> Conor – having a presence in the OS community is a way of marketing a company as cool place to candidates. A candidates online activity and comments on github can be a good ways to see how good a coder a candidate is and whether the candidate is a good culture fit based on the helpfulness of their online pull-request comments.

### Selling open source 101 - Henrik Ingo (MongoDB)

As open source has become mainstream and a business, many companies face a knowledge gap and may not even realize it: most executives and sales managers have no particular experience in the dynamics of open source. Unfortunately, most open source folks have no experience in sales either! This session will help each group to understand, and apply, both the open source and sales parts together.

### Nobody should know more about you than you do - Alistair Croll (Solve For Interesting)

In the next decade, data-driven feeds will become the primary tool with which we manage our lives. Access to that data”much of which lives behind walled gardens, or profitable arbitrage”is fast becoming a moral issue. In this session, Alistair Croll looks at the promises and perils of big data as it finds its way into our lives, and makes far too many unreasonable predictions along the way.

### JSON at work: Schema, Search, and Transform - Tom Marrs (LivingSocial) - Part 1

Most modern web APIs prefer JSON because of its interoperability. All modern languages have excellent JSON support, but large-scale environments often require more than simple serialization/de-serialization. This tutorial shows how to leverage JSON Schema, Search, and Transform along with simple tooling to enhance a developers workflow to build elegant, powerful, and efficient applications.

> Conor - This three part lab is an excellent introduction to JSON based schemas. This first part is an introduction to JSON schema. This is similar to the XML Schema Documents (XSD) used to validate the semantics of XML docs. This is a necessary step if you want to use JSON not just at the front end but as a internal messaging format in the enterprise back-end . despite being 10 years old the tools for JSON-schemas feel somewhat less polished than their XML counterparts but are still quite functional. [SLIDES](https://github.com/tmarrs/presentations/tree/master/OSCON/2015/JSON-at-Work-Schema-Search-and-Transform/slides) [see specification at json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org/) , [there's example code on github if you want to follow along (clone or download zip)](https://github.com/tmarrs/presentations)

> Conor - reviews a number of tools for schema-searching e.g xpath-like ways of searching and filtering the json content. JSONpath and JSONpointer seems to be the top tools here. Also looks at transform tools ( similar to xslt in the xml world) to convert from JSON to HTML, XML and other forms of JSON. Support here is a little more scrappy. I thought the jq tool that works with curl was a handy one for bash scripts. ALso includes two projects you can use to test out searchs and transforms.

### Speed kills: When faster pages mean less revenue - Eddie Canales (CrossChx)

Faster pages...profit! Right? Despite what common sense and every case study might tell you, we found out that isn't always true. When you get 20 million visitors a month and make a lot of your money from advertising (the enemy of speed), you have tons of opportunity/obligation to understand which kinds of speed matter. This is a story about hope, disappointment, discovery, and triumph.

> Conor - A car website that makes it's money from advertisements. turns out there is a sweetspot for user engagement with ads in how quickly they appear .

### Development, testing, acceptance and production with Docker and Kubernetes - Patrick Reilly (Kismatic, Inc.)

Docker runs your code in a container, which is like a lightweight VM. A container runs your code directly on the host operating system and hardware, but in an isolated userspace. This way, you get all the isolation and consistency benefits of a VM, but with very little overhead. If you run your code on top of Linux in production, then Docker is for you pair this with Kubernetes and you're all set.
> Conor the description above is somewhat misleading in that there is fairly little specifically related to using docker in development, test or production. This does provide a good high level overview of  docker and kubernetes.

### Getting your ducks in a row - an introduction to managing components in your software supply chain - Manfred Moser (simpligility technologies inc.)

Results of a five-year study on open source development and security practices form the basis for introducing supply chain management to your development practice. We rely on the usage of third-party components, and take on the responsibility for them and their licensing terms or security vulnerabilities. New tools for managing these components in your software development efforts are demoed.

> Conor – The java code we write has hundreds of dependencies on external libraries. There can be security issues or licencing issues with libaries. Sonatype , the guys behind the nexus application we use have an enterprise version that provides some of the audit report tools for notifing developers when their libraries should be updated. Also discusses the use of Maven Bill-of-materials BOM whe we already use, yeaaa!
